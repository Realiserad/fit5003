\section{Does the program work?}

The program was compiled successfully with \verb!gcc 0667.c -pthread -o sum!.
\\\\
The program was executed with \verb!./sum n m! and computes the sum $f(n, m) = \sum_{i=0}^{n*m-1}i$ where $n$ is the number of threads and $m$ is the increment.
\\\\
The program computed the three sums $f(1, 1)$, $f(17, 32)$ and $f(1000, 999999)$ without any errors. My conclusion is that the program works as advertised on my machine.

\section{Threats}
\begin{tabular}{ l | l | l }
  \textbf{Threat type} & \textbf{Explanation} & \textbf{Mitigated?} \\
  Integer overflow & The user inputs characters instead of numbers & \textbf{\textcolor{green}{YES}} \\
  Integer overflow & The user inputs negative values for $n$ or $m$ & \textbf{\textcolor{green}{YES}} \\
  Integer overflow & The user inputs very large values for $n$ or $m$ & \textbf{\textcolor{green}{YES}}
\end{tabular}

\section{Source code analysis}
Fortify did not detect any flaws in the code. FlawFinder warned about two things:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \verb!./0667.c:189! \textbf{Possible integer overflow if user input is too large or a negative number} \\Checks are in place to mitigate this threat (see above).
    \item \verb!./0667.c:73! \textbf{Possible buffer overread if the string is not null-terminated} \\The string checked for length is directly taken from the
    arguments list, so usage of \verb!strlen! is safe.
\end{enumerate}
\lstinputlisting[language=C]{code.c}
\noindent
The following flaws were detected after a manual walkthrough of the code:
\\\\
\begin{tabular}{ l | p{8cm}l | l }
  \textbf{Type of flaw} & \textbf{Explanation} & \textbf{Severity} \\
  Memory leak & The programmer does not free threads or thread paramaters allocated on the heap. & \textbf{\textcolor{BurntOrange}{MODERATE}} \\
  Missing null-check & The programmer does not check for null after invoking \verb!malloc!. & \textbf{\textcolor{green}{LOW}}
\end{tabular}

\section{Penetration test}
\todo{No vulnerabilities were found during penetration testing.}
